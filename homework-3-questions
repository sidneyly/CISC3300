JavaScript is a programming language that helps to create more interactive and dynamic web pages. Interpretive language like JavaScript executes code line by line without having to translate, while a complied language requires a compiler to first translate the code into machine code for the computer. 
Dynamic typed programming allows variables to be changed during runtime, while static typed programming requires the data type to be known before running. Dynamic will also check for errors at runtime, while static checks before running. Strongly typed programming language enforces data types where variables muct explicitly be defined and only works with compatible data types. Weakly typed language allows more flexibility since it automatically converts data types on the fly.
Using Var you can reassign a new value and can be redecalred. Using let will let you reassign a new value but cannot be redeclared in the same scope. Const can not be reassigned a new value once initiated and can not be redeclared.
Anonymous functions are functions that don't have names or identification. Higher functions are functions that takes one or more functions as arguements. A Callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function. A first class function can be treated like any other variable.
A Javascript object is that is a collection of properties. It includes a key/strong and a value.
