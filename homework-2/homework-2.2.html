<!--Flexbox and CSS grid are similar as they both help
structure the layout of a webpage by utlizing containers to 
encase elements in. However, Flexbox is one dimensional as 
it only does layout in either a row or a column. CSS grid is
2 dimensional where it aligns items utilizing both the rows 
and columns.-->
