                It's difficult to imagine life without computers when they're so central to 
                our information-driven global society. But it's not difficult to imagine the 
                amazing pursuits you'll be prepared for with a degree in computer science from 
                Fordham's department of Computer and Information Sciences. <br  />
                <br  />
                The computer science major emphasizes science and technology, including software design 
                and programming, computer architecture and functions, and the development of 
                an ability to analyze and solve problems in using the computer as a tool. <br  />
